## Introduction

This is an example Quarto document that leverages a **Posit Theme.** This theme was created by replacing many of the core colors within the preexisting [cosmo](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/themes/cosmo.scss) bootstrap theme.
