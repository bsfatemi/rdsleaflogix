The following chunks are executed by this document. They refresh the enumerated materialized views on our prod and dev postgres servers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## (1) Recent Product Transactions

Most recent 100 days of sales transactions in population. This is used in a number of pipelines and apps, and was initially created to reduce the runtime of generating product recommendations. This view is located in prod integrated database.

```{sql refresh_1, connection=cn_prod_int, class.source = 'fold-show'}
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY v100d_population2;
```

```{sql n_rows_1, connection=cn_prod_int, output.var = "n_rows_1", echo = FALSE}
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM v100d_population2;
```

> Total rows contained in view: `r scales::comma(as.numeric(n_rows_1$count))`

This view is located at `Prod/integrated/public/Materialized Views/v100d_population2`

## (2) Products First and Last Sales

View containing a list of all products and their first sold, and last sold dates found in population. This is used by the product recommendations API. This view is located in prod integrated database.

```{sql refresh_2, connection=cn_prod_int, class.source = 'fold-show'}
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY vproduct_history;

```{sql n_rows_2, connection=cn_prod_int, output.var = "n_rows_2", echo = FALSE}
